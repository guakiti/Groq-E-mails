A abordagem proposta visa melhorar o desempenho e a escalabilidade de aplicações de IA, tornando-as mais eficazes em diversos contextos.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"lTMiyRig14Lp"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Instalando os pactos iniciais**"],"metadata":{"id":"LSplodaH2kQE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["O CrewAi é uma plataforma projetada para facilitar a colaboração entre múltiplos agentes de inteligência artificial (IA).
